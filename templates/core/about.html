  In 2023, I graduated from Rithm Schoolâ€™s full-stack web development bootcamp, where I was engaged in each stage of the software development lifecycle, from ideation and prototyping to testing and deployment. I gained experience building web applications using JavaScript and Python frameworks such as React, Flask, Express, and Django. It was like gaining a super power: the ability to create any tool imaginable in the form of a software application.

  After receiving my BFA in Painting & Drawing from the University of Georgia, I taught English for two years at Jeonju Elementary School in Jeonju, South Korea.
  I returned to the United States and moved to Atlanta where I started working in restaurants and volunteering during my free time.
  Primarily, I taught art to individuals overcoming homelessness through Central Outreach and Advocacy Center's Art Ministry program after reading about it <a href="https://www.wabe.org/atlantas-homeless-men-finding-peace-art-class/" target="_blank">in the news</a>.
</p>
<p>
  At home, I am a lover of books, music, food, video games, and the great outdoors.
